neat.
Level Editor is complete and functional.

Level Editor Functionality:

  Upload PNG file to "Assets/Resources/Levels/". Image resolution (pixels x pixels) represents level size. Each coloured pixel is rendered as a GameObject.

  Key:
    Black (RGB: 0,0,0; Alpha: 255) - Ground Tile;
    White (RGB: 255,255,255; Alpha: 255) - Player Spawn;
    Green (RGB: 0, 255, 0; Alpha: 255) - Finish Line;

  (Any other coloured pixels might give errors or will simply not be rendered.)
